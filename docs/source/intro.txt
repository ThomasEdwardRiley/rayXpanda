Schwarzschild null geodesic expansion to high-order
***************************************************

The ``rayXpanda`` extension modules supply compiled functions for fast
approximation of several null geodesic properties in the Schwarzschild
spacetime, *without* need for numerical integration or interpolation or any
external numerical libraries for that matter. These routines can thus be used
to verify numerical integration due to the orthogonality. Alternatively, these
routines can be called directly by a given application in place of calls to
other library functions for null geodesic computation.

Install
=======

Run the ``setup.py`` script::

    CC=<compiler> python setup.py install [--user]

You require Cython to compile to C, and then the extensions will be compiled.
For example, set ``CC=gcc`` for GNU or ``CC=icc`` for Intel, depending on
your system.

If you wish to call the C functions from another Cython module, use::

    from rayXpanda.deflection cimport c_deflect
    from rayXpanda.inversion cimport c_invert

If you wish to call the C functions from a C program, use::

    #include "deflection.h"
    #include "inversion.h"

and add the ``rayXpanda`` source directory to the include path for compilation
of your C program. When linking, point to the directory containing the shared
objects that were compiled when ``rayXpanda`` was installed.

.. _sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master

To compile the documentation you require a `sphinx`_ installation::

    cd rayXpanda/docs; make html

You may then view the documentation in a browser. The files may be found in::
